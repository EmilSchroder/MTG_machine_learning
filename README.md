# MTG_machine_learning

## Intension
The purpose of this project is to develop a linear regression machine learning algorithm that can do one of two things:

1. Predict the price of a Magic: The Gathering card given a particular date,
2. Given the parameters of a hypothetical MTG card what will the initial release cost of it be.

The model will start simple, though ultimately the variables included will be: 

* Price history
* Card name
* Mana cost
* Type
* Subtype(s)
* Attributes / Abilities
* Rarity
* Set
* Power
* Toughness
* Card ID number
* Artist
* Release date

These are just the basic attributes of an MTG card and will be the starting point of the model. Additional includes will be:

* Published deck list card is included in
* Number of mentions the card gets in community forums
* What formats the card is legal in
